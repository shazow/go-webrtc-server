# go-webrtc-server

**Status**: Big pile of glittery mess. Just cobbling things together to see if
they will work for what I have in mind.

## Goals

* Drop-in Go middleware which knows how to upgrade and negotiate a WebRTC
connection automatically by using a WebSocket.
* Consistent and interchangeable connection interface for JavaScript and Go
which can be a WebRTC connection or a WebSocket connection.
